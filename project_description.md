# Face Recognition

This project implements a facial recognition system using Python. It detects faces in images and identifies known faces.

## Overview

This facial recognition system is built using Python and OpenCV library. It can detect faces in images and recognize known faces based on pre-trained models.

## Features

- Detect faces in images.
- Recognize known faces.
- Scalable and easy to use.

## Usage

1. **Installation:**
   - Clone the repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/shilpan16/face_recognition.git
     ```
   - Install dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

2. **Run the Program:**
   - Navigate to the project directory:
     ```bash
     cd face_recognition
     ```
   - Run the program:
     ```bash
     python face_recog.py
     ```

3. **Input:**
   - Place the images you want to recognize in the `test_images` directory.

4. **Output:**
   - The program will detect and recognize faces in the input images and save the result in the `output_images` directory.
